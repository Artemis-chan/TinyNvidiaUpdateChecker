# TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker

TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker (TNUC for short) is a lightweight application that checks for NVIDIA GPU drivers, written in C-sharp (C#) for Windows. When executed it will check for new driver updates. You can customize TNUC making it execute when logging in your computer, and have it only pop up if there's a new driver available.

It supports extracting drivers to only install the required driver files, which is useful since the default driver installer installs a bunch of bloatware on your computer that you don't need.

**Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/ElPumpo/TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker/wiki) page for detailed information about the application**

## Update

Thanks to everyone making TNUC popular by starring the project here on GitHub and all the people writing articles about it! Many years ago I started this as a hobby project to automate checking driver updates. I know the codebase isn't proper and I've learned a lot since then. Even today there's nearly hundreds of views on this page daily, which is huge for me, so thanks <3
