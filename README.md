# TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker

TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker (TNUC for short) is a lightweight tool that checks for NVIDIA GPU drivers for Windows. You can configure TNUC [executing it when logging in](https://github.com/ElPumpo/TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker/wiki/Quiet-runs-on-user-login), and have it only pop up if there's a new driver available.

It has a minimal install feature that extracts the GPU drivers from the otherwise bloated bundle which contains GeForce Experience, 3d drivers and other components. Nothing except the required drivers will be installed.

Uses a NVIDIA API to get the latest driver, and there is support for the majority of their GPUs. Thanks to [ZenitH-AT](https://github.com/ZenitH-AT) for their research and metadata repo used by this project.
